# Challenge

Hi!

Here you can find my proposal for the implementation, I hope you'll have the time to take a look :-). 

##Disclaimer:
Since this is a backend implementation, and it is only focus on build every unit and test them, in order to guaranty the requirement implementation but also to have a more clean approach and a proper architecture and readability.

However, any other component like, DI container router system or the implementation of a public interface to expose the functionality (like a controller, rest API ...), is out of the scope. 


I hope it covers the expectations.

Best.
